            <h3>Reading The Library of Babel in the Library</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This morning class 8a had a lesson scheduled in the library computer lab, but the Internet went down halfway
            through. Ms Morgan handed them over to me when she had finished what she could without an Internet
            connection. I thought it would be fun to blow the kids’ minds a bit and read them a story about the
            near-infinite Internet they were currently unable to access. We read The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis
            Borges. One student said that it is easier to find things on Wikipedia than in The Library of Babel, and
            also easier than finding a book in our school library. I told him he should pay closer attention next time I
            explain how to find books in the library, but that the Internet is often quite easy to navigate these days.
            However, things were not always so organized. D.C. Denison of the Boston Globe said in the early days of the
            Internet that it “may be the world’s greatest library, but let’s face it-all the books are scattered on the
            floor.” I asked if the students ever felt that the books were still scattered on the floor, or if there were
            ever just too many books to find the right one among them. A girl raised her hand and said that she had felt
            a bit sick this week. She had then looked online to see if she was coming down with something, but there
            were so many results saying different things that she just came away confused and anxious. I told her I
            hoped she was feeling better, and that she was quite similar to the librarians in the story, knowing the
            correct answer is out there, but not sure how to find it, or even to recognize it if it is found.
        </p>
        <p>Then I asked how many students had used Wikipedia to learn something this week. Most hands shot up. I asked
            the same question again, but about YouTube instead. Fewer hands were raised. A student seated at the back of
            the group said she wanted to, but ran out of data watching a video on the amphibians they were learning
            about in Biology this week. I told her that she had brought up a very important point. The Library of Babel
            talks about the structure of the library, how it has a lot of stairs, how the shelves are arranged, and how
            the librarians move around it. I asked the students what would happen if a librarian was in a wheelchair,
            and couldn’t move up or down the stairs. The student at the back responded that they wouldn’t be able to
            read any of the books that were on a higher or lower level, and that maybe the library should have some
            elevators. I told her that was a pretty good idea.
