            <h3 class="header">Reading The Library of Babel in the Library</h3>
        </header>
        <article class="media-article__article | paragraphs">
            <p>This morning class 8a had a lesson scheduled in the library computer lab, but the Internet went down
                halfway
                through. Ms Morgan handed them over to me when she had finished what she could without an Internet
                connection. I thought it would be fun to blow the kids’ minds a bit and read them a story about the
                near-infinite Internet they were currently unable to access. We read The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis
                Borges. One student said that it is easier to find things on Wikipedia than in The Library of Babel, and
                also easier than finding a book in our school library. I told him he should pay closer attention next
                time I
                explain how to find books in the library, but that the Internet is often quite easy to navigate these
                days.
                However, things were not always so organized. D.C. Denison of the Boston Globe said in the early days of
                the
                Internet that it “may be the world’s greatest library, but let’s face it-all the books are scattered on
                the
                floor.” I asked if the students ever felt that the books were still scattered on the floor, or if there
                were
                ever just too many books to find the right one among them. A girl raised her hand and said that she had
                felt
                a bit sick this week. She had then looked online to see if she was coming down with something, but there
                were so many results saying different things that she just came away confused and anxious. I told her I
                hoped she was feeling better, and that she was quite similar to the librarians in the story, knowing the
                correct answer is out there, but not sure how to find it, or even to recognize it if it is found.
            </p>
            <p>Then I asked how many students had used Wikipedia to learn something this week. Most hands shot up. I
                asked
                the same question again, but about YouTube instead. Fewer hands were raised. A student seated at the
                back of
                the group said she wanted to, but ran out of data watching a video on the amphibians they were learning
                about in Biology this week. I told her that she had brought up a very important point. The Library of
                Babel
                talks about the structure of the library, how it has a lot of stairs, how the shelves are arranged, and
                how
                the librarians move around it. I asked the students what would happen if a librarian was in a
                wheelchair,
                and couldn’t move up or down the stairs. The student at the back responded that they wouldn’t be able to
                read any of the books that were on a higher or lower level, and that maybe the library should have some
                elevators. I told her that was a pretty good idea.

                    <h3 class="header">Some Quantum Mechanics</h3>
                </header>
                <article class="media-article__article | paragraphs">
                    <p>Having read The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges with class 8a, and not having much to do
                        with the Internet down again, I read another of his great works, The Garden of Forking Paths,
                        right after the class had left. Both are such interesting explorations of the infinite and its
                        relationship to the accessibility of information. While the infinite nature of The Library of
                        Babel is what keeps its information inaccessible, the nature of the universe performs that role
                        in The Garden of Forking Paths. Obviously, Borges had some meaningful understanding of physics,
                        as the branching universe he describes treads the line between the many-worlds interpretation of
                        quantum mechanics and a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence. Though this may sound terribly
                        complex, I assure you that if I, who spent no time in university in a physics classroom, can
                        understand the basics, you can too. </p>
                    <p>
                        The first of these concepts, the many-worlds interpretation, is quite simple. When an event on
                        the quantum scale occurs, all possible outcomes of that event do in fact occur, and we only see
                        one outcome because we live on a single path, unable to occupy multiple forks at once. The
                        second, quantum decoherence, is somewhat more complex, but not beyond the understanding of a
                        layperson. Essentially, it describes a loss of information as the reason we can see only one
                        result. For a more full understanding, check out this <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs">video</a> video. This may be why the
                        character Ts’ui
                        Pên was able to create “an incomplete, but not false, image of the universe”, and why The Garden
                        of Forking Paths is seen as impossible to interpret by many who encounter it. Interestingly, our
                        ability to process new types of information today hinges on our ability to interpret forking
                        paths and decoherence inside the field of quantum computing.
