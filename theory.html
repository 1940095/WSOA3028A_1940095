                <h1>A Reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message'</h1>
                <p>Today I read a paper called <i>The Medium is the Message</i> by Marshall McLuhan. Though the piece is
                    representative of its time in a few ways, such as treatment of Africans as universally illiterate,
                    it is
                    also foresightful in its conception of “electric media” as a force of significant societal change,
                    and
                    thoughtful in considering the connection inherent between the medium of transmission and the message
                    within. After reading, I was aware of a significant prediction in the piece. McLuhan mentions that
                    “each
                    of the media is also a powerful weapon with which to clobber other media and other groups. The
                    result is
                    that the present age has been one of multiple civil wars that are not limited to the world of art
                    and
                    entertainment” (McLuhan, 1964).
                </p>
                <p>This has proven true in every new form of media we have created since McLuhan wrote this paper,
                    perhaps
                    even progressively so, with the newest forms of media, social media, featuring extraordinary amounts
                    of
                    direct conflict (Anderson, 2018) (Leighton, 2019). It is also the case that this trend of increasing
                    conflict follows the trend of increasing interactability of new media. If this understanding is
                    correct,
                    then over time our conflicts in the real world may continue to be superseded by conflicts in the
                    progressively interactable realm of digital media. It may be the case then, that as these new media
                    become the “technological staples”, the “unique cultural flavor” (McLuhan, 1964) they bring may be
                    one
                    of division and discord.

                <br>
                <h1>The Memex and the Message</h1>
                <p>Vannevar Bush’s paper As We May Think was written half a century before his ideas manifested in
                    the World Wide Web. On its 65th anniversary, the paper was reviewed by Simon Harper in ‘As We
                    May Think’ At 65, discussing the value and predictive power it holds even today. Noted in
                    Harper’s paper, is Bush’s intention for the Memex to be a mechanical device, elucidating the
                    fact that all technologies Bush discussed take a significantly different physical form today
                    than he predicted. Nonetheless, ideas and insights from his paper remain deeply relevant, such
                    as the idea that the Memex would be a “device for individual use”, adapted to its user and their
                    specific needs. Harper makes this idea explicit, saying “The key point here is the idea that
                    human understanding and cognition can be enhanced by tailoring information, and the associations
                    between this information, to the way that the human brain is organised”.

                </p>
                <p>Online services such as Spotify, Netflix, and Facebook have taken this concept and applied it to
                    human experience, enhancing each user’s time on their platform by providing content tailored to
                    the individual. In the case of Netflix, different users are shown different cover art for the
                    same shows and movies depending on a digital psychological profile created by algorithmic
                    processing of their viewing habits, with the purpose of providing quality information about each
                    show or movie to users who process information uniquely. The contrast of Bush’s spot on “vision
                    of how information could be manageable even on a large scale by association based on the
                    experience of the individual” and his far less accurate idea of the medium through which that
                    information would pass calls into question the strength of the idea that the medium is the
                    message.

                </p>

                <p>I have discussed Marshall McLuhan’s idea of the message being inseparable from the message on
                    this blog before. McLuhan provides historical evidence to back up his theory, such as the effect
                    of print media on the French Revolution. Yet, looking back from McLuhan’s perspective, and
                    forward from Bush’s, it seems plausible that the medium does not so much affect the message as
                    it enables new kinds of messages to be popularized. Bush predicted the individualisation of the
                    message not because his preferred medium of “rods, gears, pulleys and rotors” imbues information
                    with an essence of the individual, but because computation allows fundamentally new kinds of
                    messages to be transmitted. Perhaps print only provided the ideas of liberté, égalité, and
                    fraternité a mode of transmission, and had radio instead of print emerged as the technology of
                    transmission at the time, a very similar French Revolution would have occurred, with the same
                    message of liberté, égalité, and fraternité as its engine.

                <h1>What Do Users Have To Say About Design?</h1>
                <p>The paper <i>Revealing the Hidden Rationality of User Browsing Behaviour</i> is another older paper I
                    have read recently. It contains a data-driven analysis of three different types of communicative
                    techniques within web design; Visual, Verbal, and Neutral. It asks the question of whether different
                    users have preferences for one type of design over another, with the hope that the answer could
                    provide insights into how personalisation might be used to enhance educational web applications.
                    With the advent of significant remote learning activities in early 2020, and with their continued
                    presence up until the present day, even a small design change on educational websites could have a
                    large impact.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before analysing the paper’s finding, it is worth examining when and how it arrived at those answers.
                    The first issue worth highlighting is the date the paper was published, back in 2007. For average
                    academic writing, this is not terribly old, but technology moves faster than other fields, and web
                    technology specifically so. As such, the findings may not be as relevant today as they were then.
                    Secondly, the sample of users tested, only 144, was made up entirely of Computer Science students
                    from the University of Nottingham. This sample is not a representative slice of any population, as
                    women have historically been underrepresented of in Computer Science, and older users experience the
                    web, and technology in general, differently than those of average college age. Additionally, half of
                    the sessions did not switch between the modes, leaving the sample size for some calculations at only
                    84.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now that some important shortcomings of the paper have been addressed, the findings can be better
                    understood in context. Likely as expected, the more visual modes faired significantly better than
                    the Verbal mode. This reinforces the idea the visual stimulus such as images is important for
                    maintaining the attention of a user, and that text-heavy design is not as accessible. The paper
                    found little evidence of mode switching as a preference driven activity, meaning there it provides
                    no evidence personalization would improve learning outcomes. However, the paper did find that mode
                    switching could be used to alleviate boredom. This finding has the implication that monotonous
                    design may lead to less attention from users and poorer educational outcomes, and design which
                    introduces a new look to an application after some time may improve attention and lead to better
                    educational outcomes. This is not a surprising outcome, but it is clear in the data and easily
                    actionable by web designers. Further study is needed to reproduce this outcome more robustly, but in
                    the meantime, designing applications with more interesting and varied interfaces may not be a bad
                    habit.

                <h1>Internet Inequities</h1>
                <br>
                <p><i>Towards a study of information geographies:(im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the
                        geographies of information </i>is a paper which, through vast amounts of data superbly
                    visualized, demonstrates the inequities that exist on the Internet. Though this study is from before
                    oceanic currents worsened the African continent’s access to the Internet, its relevance is not
                    diminished but rather amplified, as the inequities it outlines have been amplified. Of particular
                    interest to me, and I believe to South Africa, is the discrepancy between the population of internet
                    users and domain names, Wikipedia edits, and GitHub commits outlined in the study. This represents a
                    difference in agency online, and a difference in who is speaking and who is listening.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Internet is powerful. This is not a disputed fact. Having a voice on the Internet is having
                    power, and this power can be used to spread truth or lies, and mobilize hate or compassion. When
                    oppressors are the ones with a voice, they use it for their own gain at the expense of others, and
                    are able to spread lies and hate on a whim. At no time was this clearer than during Donald Trump’s
                    four years as president of the United States, with his prolific use of Twitter inspiring multiple
                    acts of violence. But when the oppressed can speak up and be heard, truth can break through and
                    instigate change. At no time was this clearer than during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020,
                    ignited in response to a video of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of four police officers. The
                    video was widely shared on social media, spoken so loudly and so ubiquitously that it could not go
                    unheard, even by those who tried to ignore it. The changes brought about because of that voice,
                    amplified by millions of black people with lived experience of racial discrimination around the
                    world, though far from enough, is significant and important. Lives are demonstrably better today
                    than they were in 2020 because of that voice.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>But South Africans and other Africans today do not have a voice like those in Europe or North
                    America, and we go unheard because of it. We do not even write our own stories. They are written by
                    others. This is exemplified by the data on Wikipedia edits for the African continent, where only 5%
                    of edits on articles about Africa are made by Africans. This kind of digital colonialism extends to
                    South Africa as well, where we write less than half of Wikipedia articles about ourselves.
                    Structural changes are needed to address this issue, such as Wikipedia servers located in Africa for
                    when undersea fibre is disrupted. I hope my own small actions, such as the GitHub commit that will
                    send this article online, push the world slightly in the right direction.</p>
