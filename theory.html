        </header>
        <article class="media-article__article | paragraphs">
            <p>Today I read a paper called <i>The Medium is the Message</i> by Marshall McLuhan. Though the piece is
                representative of its time in a few ways, such as treatment of Africans as universally illiterate, it is
                also foresightful in its conception of “electric media” as a force of significant societal change, and
                thoughtful in considering the connection inherent between the medium of transmission and the message
                within. After reading, I was aware of a significant prediction in the piece. McLuhan mentions that “each
                of the media is also a powerful weapon with which to clobber other media and other groups. The result is
                that the present age has been one of multiple civil wars that are not limited to the world of art and
                entertainment” (McLuhan, 1964).
            </p>
            <p>This has proven true in every new form of media we have created since McLuhan wrote this paper, perhaps
                even progressively so, with the newest forms of media, social media, featuring extraordinary amounts of
                direct conflict (Anderson, 2018) (Leighton, 2019). It is also the case that this trend of increasing
                conflict follows the trend of increasing interactability of new media. If this understanding is correct,
                then over time our conflicts in the real world may continue to be superseded by conflicts in the
                progressively interactable realm of digital media. It may be the case then, that as these new media
                become the “technological staples”, the “unique cultural flavor” (McLuhan, 1964) they bring may be one
                of division and discord.
